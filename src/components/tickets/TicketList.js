    const [emergency, setEmergency] = useState(false) //this is another State variable that will track whether or not an emergencyticket should be listed for the user/employee...and we set the default to false, meaning that ALL tickets will be shown, not just the emergency ones
    const [openOnly, updateOpenOnly] = useState(false) //* this is a react hook. It takes from the react library of tools and does something. Basically it acts like a function. It creates a "state variable" called openOnly. Variables hold data. What data? In this case, it will hold only the tickets that are still open. But this is a "state" variable....meaning the value of this variable changes. It may be 3 tickets right now...but once a ticket is completed, the balue of openOnly will change to 2. If one is added later, it goes back to three...etc. 
    //? what about the false? That is the initial value of the state variable. openOnly is a data type of boolean, meaning the data (ticket) is either open or completed. So the initial value of any ticket in the openOnly array of tickets is "false".
    //* updateOpenOnly is a callback function that is used to update the "openOnly" value. When? When a ticket is completed or a new ticket is added. So how do we know when a ticket is added or removed(completed)? We have to watch the state of the tickets array. How? With useEffect i think.
